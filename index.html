        <h4>What is a bad date?</h4>
        <p class="p1"><img src="img/safety.png" alt="statistics about violence in sex work" class="align-left">A "bad date" is an encounter between a sex worker / anyone involved in the sex trade and someone who is violent / abusive in any way. It is also any incident of theft, refusal of payment, threats, rudeness, harassment, aggressive behaviour, etc. A bad date is anything you would want to warn or let others sex workers know about so they can avoid them and stay safe.</p><br>
        <br>
